Hem Services

This ruby program provides an easy to use interface to the Home Energy Manager RESTful services.

There will be spelling mistakes in here, so be forewarned.  This isn't shakespeare after all ;)

If you do find something in here that bothers you, or need some help, send me a note at
sam dot sabey at smartenergygroups.com  I will be too happy to help.


To get this going, get it from git:

<git link>

### Ruby

The scripts assume you have compliled your own ruby, and Ruby lives at:

/usr/local/bin/ruby

If however you have installed the package via some other release mechanism,
just remove the local from the above path to read

/usr/bin/ruby


###  Dependencies:

You will need ruby installed
You will need rubygems installed

Note, the objective is to not require a Rails installation.
You can go here to find the answer to the above two questions:
http://rubyonrails.org/download
Note, just follow the Ruby and Rubygems parts.  Skip rails.  (unless you want to get on da train)


Gem Dependencies

gem install builder   # This makes XML for use by the program.
gem install termios   # this allows the program to talk to your USB serial port
gem install nokigiri  # this parses XML


### Nokogiri notes.

This top gem can be a little windy to install, and here is the procedure I've used:


...Prep for nokogiri XML parser taken from
http://hightechsorcery.com/2008/12/howto-install-nokogiri-gem-ubuntu

>>> Install libxml2
http://www.techsww.com/tutorials/libraries/libxml/installation/installing_libxml_on_ubuntu_linux.php

as root, do the following

wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-sources-2.7.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf libxml2-sources-2.7.3.tar.gz
cd libxml2-2.7.3
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libxml2
make
make install

>>> Install libxslt
http://www.techsww.com/tutorials/libraries/libxslt/installation/installing_libxslt_on_ubuntu_linux.php

as root do the following

sudo -i
cd sources

wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
tar -xvzf libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
cd libxslt-1.1.24
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libxslt --with-libxml-prefix=/usr/local/libxml2/
make
make install

sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install tenderlove-frex

sudo gem install nokogiri

###  Usage

Note, have a look into the file main.rb, which goes through some usage examples, which work.
This will be useful to run, and figure ou what's going on when yoru computer interacts with the HEM.

To get useful information about the site you want to interact with make the following call:

in this example, the long winded token represents your Site Token for the site in question.
You can find this out from HEM.

You can choose to get XML or json representations of the response by modifying the requesty


For json
response = HemAdapter.send_command(:command => '/api_sites/f368b195a1d974457595a90416a312e11e48be94.json',
                                    :method => :get)

For xml
response = HemAdapter.send_command(:command => '/api_sites/f368b195a1d974457595a90416a312e11e48be94.xml',
                                    :method => :get)

This will give a whole bunch of xml to play with, which you can fiddle and parse to your heards content,
or you could send it in on into the parser that will return you a nice site object, complete with the relevant
gear all mapped out for your ease of programatic interaction.

There are other useful examples inside the files

Important, have a gander at:

   api_sites_put_example.rb
   api_sites_get_example.rb

   for a working example to fiddle about with
