# This program doesn't represent any actual usefulness for your projects apart from demonstrating the
# useage of the various functions within the HEM adaptor.
#
# So test away as you please, and you can incorporate these method calls within your ruby project.
#
# Note you WILL need to get your site key, available within HEM when you edit your site.
#



# The following has a token for my site, so please be careful - and it is subject to change ;)
